Born in Indiana in 1983.

Grew up not far away until 2001, when I moved a little farther away for college.

Moved much farther away in 2005. Have resided in Oregon ever since.

Was a graphics journalist at a mid-sized daily newspaper for 10 years before making a career change to web development.

Have since worked at a medium-sized engineering firm working on all kinds of interesting technology projects to help our scientists and engineers get their work done.

Leading with all of that only scratches the surface, of course. I don't really consider my job to be my defining charactaristic. But I will probably use this space to write about web development, among other things, and you should know that up front.
