I read two articles about dead musicians that seemed related, so I'll share here.

Julianne Escobedo Shepherd [offered a write-up of a new documentary about Jeff Buckley](https://www.hearingthings.co/jeff-buckley-documentary-review/), which places his admiration for women singers in context, making his chameleonic voice seem even more beautiful in retrospect. I'll be checking out that doc as soon as I can.

Elsewhere, John Darnielle (of the Mountain Goats fame) eschews the classic obituarian list of achievements and instead [writes about how Ozzy Osbourne's voice makes you feel](https://pitchfork.com/features/ozzy-osbourne-obituary-john-darnielle/).

Good stuff.
