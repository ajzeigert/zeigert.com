I'm trying to get into the habbit of collecting the kinds of links that I would thoughtlessly throw at social media into posts on this blog. So, here's a first dump.

### Little French Key Island

I recently completed my [Open Water Diver](https://store.padi.com/en-us/courses/open-water-diver/p/60462-1B2C/) certification and so of course I've been [searching](https://www.padi.com/dive-site/united-states-of-america-usa/sund-rock-marine-preserve/#overview) for [additional](https://www.padi.com/dive-site/united-states-of-america-usa/sund-rock-marine-preserve/#overview) diving opportunities. [Little French Key Island](https://www.littlefrenchkeyisland.com/), based entirely on their website, seems like a lux place to go. Seriously, just check out their website.

### Flux Blog playlists

[Flux Blog](https://fluxblog.substack.com/p/fluxblog-493-a-history-of-alternative) is home to so many great playlists that explore genres and periods in popular music. Matthew Perpetua is a prolific playlister, their site is a great place to find playlists for just about any mood.

### Lazarus Corporation blog

I discovered Paul Watson through his superb [Rituals & Declarations zine](https://shop.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/category/zines), which is sadly no longer produced. But Watson's website remains an excellent place to follow trends in modern esoterica[^1], with the added bonus of having a strong indieweb ethos. For example, his recent G[othic Studies RSS Starter Pack](https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/posts/the-gothic-studies-rss-starter-pack).

[^1]: Or modern occultism or paganism or witchcraft or whatever you want to call it. Mostly cool people with a taste for the gothic who are varying levels of serious about it.

### Midnight Companions v2

Speaking of zines, the first volume of Midnight Companions was great, I'll definitely be ordering [this one](https://midnightcompanions.bigcartel.com/product/midnight-companions-2) soon.

### Lair and other cool audio plugins

I've recently [been dabbling](/img/she_is_being_followed.mp3) in making little synth songs on my laptop. Mostly dungeon-synth adjacent, maybe soundtracks for fictional horror films, that kind of thing. So I've been exploring the world of digital audio workstation plugins. [Abberant DSP](https://aberrantdsp.com/) makes some of the coolest ones. Not merely fun audio tools, but with charming UIs to go along with them. Seriously, check out [Lair](https://aberrantdsp.com/plugins/lair/) and especially the video embedded there. A work of art all on its own.

### Paintings of Mary Tonkin

A [recent Tyler Crook post on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mrtylercrook.bsky.social/post/3lu6ty23osc2k) pointed me toward the [paintings of Mary Tonkin](https://australiangalleries.com.au/exhibitions/mary-tonkin-sr24-both-sides-now/). Dazzling stuff. I'd love to see her work in person.
