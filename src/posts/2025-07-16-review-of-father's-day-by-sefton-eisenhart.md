Father's Day by Sefton Eisenhart | ★★★★★

![Cover of Father's Day by Sefton Eisenhart](/img/fathers_day_cover.jpg#thumbnail)

I'm a fan of a certain kind of crime writing. [Big-city organized crime?](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL5680231M/The_godfather) Sure, I'll take it. Urban low lifes eking out a living a la _[Criminal](https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/criminal)_ by Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips, not to mention the century of writers that influenced them? Yeah, I'm into that. But there's something special about the rural, small-potatoes crime stories that Sefton Eisenhart's latest story, _Father's Day_, embodies that appeals to me. 

Maybe it's my small-town, midwest origins, having grown up around the kinds of people that populate stories like these, with their desperation mixed with a deep sense of pride, their fucked-up bonds to family and community.

Anyway, it's a brief foray into a world that I'd gladly spend more time in. I kept thinking back to Frank Bill's collection of Ohio River Valley miscreants in _[Crimes in Southern Indiana](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374532888/crimesinsouthernindiana/)._ Ida from _Father's Day_ would have fit right in.

As a bonus, Nantucket Lit has published a lovely limited edition of _Father's Day_ in chapbook format, typeset using a vintage electric typewriter. It lends the story a timeless quality, something from a world where the internet hasn't quite permeated. [Read up](https://nantucketlit.com/fathersday) on the typesetting on Nantucket Lit's website.
