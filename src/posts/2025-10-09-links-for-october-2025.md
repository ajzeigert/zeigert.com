_**Editor's note:** This was supposed to be a September post but I got busy and it slipped into October, so forgive me if any of these are stale._

Still have my little Tonic Pocket Operator, which I play around with every once in a while. I've always kind of wanted one of these nice cases, but the price point always seemed a little too high, and I thought that if I waited a year or two, it would come down or the resale market would hook me up. But alas, the price remains the same. I left it open in a tab for a couple weeks to see if I could justify the purchase, but I could not at this time.

Now that Glitch is going away, there's space in the market for a tool for making simple websites right in the browser. Wobble is one such attempt, and I like the amount of thought that went into its user experience.

Custom-made, halloween-themed watercolors!

As a person who has to manage a bunch of node projects, this absolutely captured my interest. I haven't implemented it yet, but I'm hoping to soon.

It's a podcast about doom metal and stoner rock and it's one of my favorites. If you are at all interested in the genre, this is the finger on the pulse. The hosts are great and feel very human. More like listening to a few folks sitting at the bar shooting the shit than listening to three dudes record in their pristine home studios.

I'm 5 years later than most but I've got a sourdough starter in a jar on the counter. Several loaves and doughs in and I'm starting to understand some of the higher level concepts.

Already preordered. As far as I'm concerned this is the high water mark for small press magazines in the modern era.

Ever really thought about ditching your smartphone and going back to a bar phone and an iPod? I have. I've thought about it a lot.

I don't know if anyone else has a "modern" car that eschews the spare in favor of a can of fix-a-flat, but I might be picking up one of these soon, at least for long trips.
