Long Live Evil by Sarah Reese Brennan | ★★★★☆

This book attempts to achieve a delicate balance between cheeky and self-serious and mostly succeeds. Ostensibly an "adult" novel from a reliable YA author, this had the flavor of YA with just a few shakes from the spice tin. I was far more engaged with the second half than the first, which I think is hard to pull off with a concept story like this. The ending hit the right balance of closure with the promise of more to come. I'll definitely keep an eye out for the next in the series.
