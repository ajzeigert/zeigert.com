Tongues Vol. 1 by Anders Nilsen | ★★★★☆

I've only read [one other Anders Nilsen comic](https://www.andersbrekhusnilsen.com/books-comics/in-your-next-life-you-will-be-together-with-all-of-your-friends), and it was more of a collection of sketches and shorter work. [Tongues](https://www.andersbrekhusnilsen.com/books-comics/tongues-volume-i
) is on a much grander scale.

It feels sprawling at first as the narrative jumps around between seemingly unconnected characters, but the whole eventually takes shape. Sharply drawn and written, it's an impressive doorstop of a book. Vol. 1 ends with a bit of a cliffhanger, but does give the reader a few important reveals. I might have to pick up individual issues from now on.
