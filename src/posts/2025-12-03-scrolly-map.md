![Scrolly map](/img/scrollymap.png)

My day job is mostly making little javascript apps, deploying them to cloud services, and then maintaining those little apps.

[Here's an example of a little scrolly map](/projects/scrollymap) that I made ages ago and just discovered on a backup drive. It was intended to be a widget map that would be on display in a corporate lobby, but it never made it to production. It's little more than a proof-of-concept at this stage.

It's nothing special. One of millions of little javascript maps that were made in the '10s as that technology became ubiquitous. I just thought it worked really nicely for what it was and decided to host it here as an example of the kind of thing I do. I was honestly surprised that it still worked, given that it uses CDNs and how quickly this industry has changed since 2017.

Not saying who the potential corporate client was but also not hiding it.
