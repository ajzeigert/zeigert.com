I'm part of a [Vampire: The Masquerade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade) coterie (2nd edition) and this is my character, Colombo Rosso. He's a late-middle-aged gardener-turned-vampire who weilds a Hori Hori knife he was given by a vampire boss early in our story.

I wanted to make a [Saint prayer card](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=saint+prayer+card&iax=images&ia=images)-style illustration of him, but also wanted to get out my linucut tools again. 

I'm sort of disappointed in how it turned out, but making lino prints is fun. I might go back and try a more painted style at some point.
