One of my regular running routes takes me along the access road for a local canal. It's a public right-of-way as well as a road regularly used by the [Central Oregon Irrigation District](https://coid.org/).[^1]

[^1]: The history of the little irrigation fiefdoms in our corner of the world is fascinating and worthy of a full post. Someday.

The canal itself passes under a highway, and the access road passes under through its own little tunnel, barely wide enough for a truck to pass through, but perfect for pedestrian traffic. It's maybe a hundred feet long. Concrete and blacktop. Adequate drainage. Utilitarian.

But what it unexpectadly offers is a huge, secluded concrete canvas for local taggers and graffiti artists. And they are locked in a constant struggle with COID, who apparently prefer the walls to be grayish tan at all times. Any graffito here is ephemeral, destined to be painted over by the district within a week or two of appearing. [^2]

[^2]: I've seen the crews out there painting over the graffiti. Often it appears to be a crew of youths doing community service under supervision. I often wonder if they are the very same people who made the marks, pressganged by society to erase their own work. Another story for another post.

Spray painting these walls is illegal, make no mistake. But places like this are destined to be gallaries for punks and weirdos, and maybe we should allow a little room in our society for outsider art. Just please don't tag my garage door.

I'm not an art critic and especially not a graffiti critic. Many of the marks I've seen are amateur, rudimentary, perhaps created in haste and with little to say. But I've documented many of them. 

Here are my favorites.[^3] I'll post more when I get 'em.

Graffiti can be a wonderful ongoing conversation between both artist and cleanup crew.
