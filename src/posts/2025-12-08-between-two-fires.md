[“Between Two Fires” by Christopher Beuhler](https://christopherbuehlmanauthor.com/book/between-two-fires/) | ★★★★★ 5/5 stars

I won’t belabor this review as it’s for a book published more than ten years ago, but it was a perfect October book for me. (And yes, I'm publishing this in December. Such is my life.)

Set during the Black Death in France, the book follows a disgraced knight, a priest and a mysterious girl as they make their way across a land afflicted by death both earthly and not. Essentially a smaller-scale The Stand set in medieval times. Although the scale ends up being just as biblical, so maybe that’s not quite right. Reading it felt like the literary equivalent of a Hieronymus Bosch painting, a world both familiar and startling.

Highly enjoyed.
