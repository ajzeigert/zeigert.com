A couple years ago I had the privilege of creating illustrations for [Central Oregon Book Project](https://centraloregonbookproject.com/) a volume put together and edited by writer (and close friend of mine) [Kimberly Bowker](https://kimberlybowker.com/).

The book was funded on Kickstarter and published in a nice little modern zine format. It contains prose and poetry from a number of local authors waxing eloquent about our High Desert home.

I liked some of those pen and ink drawings, so I'm sharing them below.

I grew up in the flat Midwest, which has a beauty of its own, but when I moved out west I immediately fell in love with the prominent volcanic features of Central Oregon, a potent reminder that the surface of the earth is not still, it is constantly remaking itself, even if our short human life spans can't perceive it.
