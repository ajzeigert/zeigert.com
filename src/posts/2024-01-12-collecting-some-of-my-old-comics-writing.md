I'm an avid comics reader. I still keep a pullbox at my [local comic shop](https://www.facebook.com/people/Pegasus-Books-of-Bend/100057318914816/), although my pull list maybe isn't as deep as it once was.

For a while I wanted to get into comics criticism, so I wrote a handful of reviews for a small site called Comic Book Daily. The archive of my reviews is still available [on their site](https://www.comicbookdaily.com/category/columns/shelf-39/).

I also wrote [another, more indepth review](
http://festivalseason.org/reviews/beans-greens-and-a-snake-in-the-garden/) for a website called Festival Season, which I really liked, but has been defunct for a while.

Perhaps I should archive them on this site eventually, before the tides of the internet inevitablely wash them away.

Eventually I'd like to keep track of my comics reading on this site, whether it's full reviews or just a reading tracker. Someday.
