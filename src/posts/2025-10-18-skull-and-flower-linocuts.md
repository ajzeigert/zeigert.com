*The finished product, before numbering*

I've been an on-and-off printmaker for 25 years. Less so, recently. But the phrase "death is renewal" and variants of that had been running through my ead for a week or so, and I decided a print was in order.

Pewter ink on 5x7 printmaking paper. I added some watercolors to the flowers.

Anybody want one? Limited run of six. (Plus one gold flower that was printed from an old plate.) I'll send it in an envelope for the low, low price of emailing me at andy@zeigert.com with your mailing address. I will burn your email after reading.

*Couldn't find my old barren or ink plate, so I used a candle and the back of a binder*
