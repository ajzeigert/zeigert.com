I have a memory from childhood of spending time at a lake house with my parents. We rented it, this was long before AirBnB. It was a cool A frame house with a staircase that went right down to a nice dock with a pontoon boat that we could use. I always remembered it as "Hike Lake" but I had no real memory of where exactly it was. I knew it was in southern Michigan somewhere, but that was about it. And it turns out searching the web for "hike lake michigan" or a million variations of that was extremely unhelpful. 

Anyway, after a fruitless search I finally suspected that it must have had some odd spelling variation, so I started searching for a bunch of different spellings and eventually found it.

I've had this map open in a tab for a week and it felt like some important comment was on the tip of my tongue. Even with what feels like the entirety of human knowledge only a few clicks/taps away, there remain things that are hard to find. I couldn't remember the actual name, and the details I could remember made it difficult to search for. 

There are other things like this, things I remember but that I can't find any trace of on the internet because I don't remember the right search terms. 

I'm going to end this post before I end up down some rabbit hole about human knowledge and technology.
