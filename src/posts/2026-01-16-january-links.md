I spent a good part of the last month down with the flu. I'm several weeks past day zero and still waking up with a frog in my throat, although it's a little better every day. I hope you and yours are healthy. This influenza A variant that's going around is no slouch.

I've been collecting tabs and it's time to dump them here so I can close them.

- [Strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc) is (perhaps yet another) [music programming](https://github.com/zoejane/awesome-music-programming) platform. I remember playing with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) ages ago, but I like that Strudel seems to be browser-centric. 

- I did about 3 days of last month's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1) before getting stumped/distracted. 

- I haven't been really into desktop flight sims in ages, maybe ever really. But the open source [Flight Gear](https://www.flightgear.org/) piqued my interest again.

- Look at [these illustrations by Ninn Salaün](https://www.ninnsalaun.com/digitalillustrations)

- This might be niche, and maybe you don't need shampoo to bring you joy, [but maybe you do.](https://www.lush.com/us/en_us/p/big-shampoo/115g).

- [Wig Shop](https://www.wigshopwebshop.com/) continues to be a place I browse regularly. Comic shops and comic news sites are absolutely clogged with cape shit, and I have little to no interest in that. But comics as a medium still brings me great joy, and Wig Shop is one of the best online purveyors of the good stuff. Or at least the weird stuff.

- I love weird little online mags. [Foofaraw](https://foofaraw.press/) seems like a great weird little online mag.

- Although I've been leaning back toward traditional tools lately, I still dabble with Procreate. I've wonderered if anyone's had success with any accessories like the [PenPad](https://pen.tips/products/penpad?variant=50187677335883)? I'm tempted.

- I love a good tutorial, and I love [a good web map tutorial](https://palewi.re/docs/first-basemap/) best.

- Should I order a [$120 Asaro head](https://www.planesofthehead.com/dev/product/oiginal-head/) or ask someone I know with a 3D printer to make one for me? 

- [f*te](https://www.fxte.co/) seems like a cool kids version of Letterboxd? Here's [a list Jessa Crispin](https://www.fxte.co/jessacrispin/4b0f23cc-a1e4-4a1b-848b-207d125437b9) made for people that enjoyed [No Other Choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygNmYP-NQEc)?

I've been playing around with the formatting of these link dumps. Do folks like seeing the full URLs when sharing links? Or are hyperlinks OK?
